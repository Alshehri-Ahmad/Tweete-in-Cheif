## General Assembly : Data Science FINAL PROJECT

## PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETS 

## Problem Statement:
At times, Trump appears to tweet based on what has grabbed his attention at any given moment. What sort of topics grabs his attention and how people are reacting to it.

## Goal:

My goal is to build a classification model that can then be applied to unseen data in an automated tweet labeling system.

## Workflow:

1.	Get the date
2.	Start preprocessing the unlabeled tweets 
3.	Apply unsupervised clustering algorithm to group tweets to different categories 
4.	labelled tweets can be fed into supervised machine learning models to train the model to understand the underlying similarities of tweets belonging to each category. 
5.	A fully trained tweet classification model can then be applied to unseen data in an automated tweet labeling system. 

## Data:  

A live-updating JSON database is available containing all of President Donald J. Trump's tweets. The data set also includes basic metadata: time tweeted, retweets, favorites, and more. It is updated hourly.

## Challenge:  

I chose to work on this project in order to learn about natural language processing. Also because this project needs both analysis of the nature of the data and the prediction of the outcome which is the tweet class
